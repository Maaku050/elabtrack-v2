# Initial delivery roadmap

Confirmed sequence from current stakeholder direction. **Phase 0 and Phase 1A–1I are complete within recorded source/disposable-local scope. Phase 2 design was delivered with policy blockers; Phase 2.5 has now reconciled29 owner working decisions and satisfies its documentation exit gate. Phase 3A is READY FOR SEPARATE AUTHORIZATION, NOT STARTED.** Latest authorization covers Phase 2.5 Markdown/domain design only. Later outcomes are sequencing guidance, not permission to execute them. Production operations, delivery and migration gates remain specific to later work. See [current readiness](PHASE2_5_REPORT.md).

## Phase 0 — Rebaseline & Template Adaptation

- **Goal:** Establish the current FSMO project contract and clean starter identity.
- **Primary deliverables:** Charter, source policy, decisions/open questions, roadmap, foundation audit, security backlog, adapted agent rules, minimal placeholder, validation report.
- **Dependencies:** Stakeholder brief, capstone, V1 audit and source inventory.
- **Explicit non-goals:** No product features, domain tables, V1 Firebase access or Phase 1 hardening implementation.
- **Exit gate:** Source-grounded documents and cleanup reviewed; reference hygiene proven; quality gates pass or blockers explicitly prevent unconditional closure.

## Phase 1 — Engineering Foundation

- **Goal:** Make the retained bootstrap reproducible, testable and secure enough for later product work.
- **Primary deliverables:** Verified module identity/toolchains, environment validation, API contracts, session infrastructure hardening, migration safety, CI/quality baseline.
- **Dependencies:** Phase 0 report; resolve environment/identity blockers and prioritize security backlog.
- **Explicit non-goals:** No equipment/borrowing/report/kiosk business behavior; no premature infrastructure.
- **Exit gate:** Foundation quality gates and critical security acceptance tests pass; production defaults fail safely; remaining risks recorded. Product auth policy remains Phase 4 work.

## Phase 1A–1E — Completed source foundation

Production configuration/runtime safety; authentication/current-account authorization; JWT/hash-only transactional refresh; browser session architecture; HTTP/API security. Completion is scoped to each report, with all live integration requirements retained. No product policies were inferred.

## Phase 1F — API Contracts, Logging & Observability

- **Goal/deliverables:** Consistent API success/error/validation contracts, centralized safe mapping, request ID propagation, structured redacted operational/security/lifecycle logging, typed client failures and explicit health/readiness.
- **Dependencies:** Completed 1A–1E; current retained routes/session/perimeter preserved.
- **Non-goals:** No real PostgreSQL/migration/browser/Docker runtime, telemetry vendor, business audit schema, product UI or mockups.
- **Exit gate:** Foundation contracts/logging/security tests and required local quality/Compose checks pass; unverified runtime evidence carried to 1G. Current report records actual gate state.

## Phase 1G — Real Integration Verification

- **Goal/deliverables:** Authorized isolated PostgreSQL startup/migrations/rollback/TLS/credential restrictions, hash persistence/transaction/concurrent refresh, cleanup; Docker/nginx/browser cookie/bootstrap/logout/CORS/CSP/proxy/rate and health/readiness verification; real request-ID/log/redaction and cross-tab/lost-response checks.
- **Dependencies:** Phase 1F and an explicitly authorized isolated environment; no V1 access implied.
- **Non-goals:** No business features or automatic migration-runner redesign; record runner limitations for 1H.
- **Exit gate:** Actual runtime/integration evidence with recovery and concurrent cases; offline doubles alone do not establish completion.

## Phase 1H — Migration Runner & Database Privilege Hardening

- **Goal/deliverables:** Atomic DDL/bookkeeping, immutable paired checksums, native advisory exclusion, strict history/discovery/error handling, explicit CLI, migration/runtime credential and ownership separation, real failure/concurrency/privilege/API/auth tests.
- **Evidence:** Stakeholder's boss-rebuild audit comparison and current runner both identify DDL commit before separate bookkeeping, no checksums/lock and lookup failure ambiguity.
- **Dependencies:** Phase 1G evidence and separate authorization; must precede heavy reliance on business-domain migrations.
- **Non-goals:** No product tables, automatic startup migrations or infrastructure platform redesign.
- **Exit gate:** Satisfied locally: transaction/version integrity, corruption/concurrent-run denial, correct error propagation and separated-role API/auth operation demonstrated against isolated PostgreSQL; standard/race/Compose gates pass. Production role/TLS deployment remains unverified.

## Phase 1I — Cross-Tab Session Coordination

- **Goal/deliverables:** Coordinate same-origin cookie-changing operations and peer session/logout lifecycle before product UI, preserving memory-only access/HttpOnly refresh and strict single-use server rotation.
- **Evidence:** Real Phase 1G/1H browser race: one refresh succeeds; a late losing 401 clears the shared winner cookie. Peer logout leaves another tab apparently authenticated until refresh fails.
- **Dependencies:** Completed 1H and explicit Phase 1I authorization, received 2026-10-07; required before Phase 2/product UI.
- **Non-goals:** No usable-token broadcast/persistence, server replay relaxation, business schema/features or CI platform implementation inferred from this requirement.
- **Exit gate:** **Satisfied / COMPLETE, 2026-10-08.** Original defect reproduced before fixes; Web Locks serialize cookie mutations and BroadcastChannel carries strict non-secret lifecycle hints. Refresh failures never delete possibly newer cookies. Real two/three-tab pressure, simultaneous reload, logout/private-cache removal, delayed-success fencing, disable/revoke, owner close, stale events and unavailable-primitive fallback pass. PostgreSQL retains one winner/11 denials; standard/race/Compose/log/diff gates pass. See the [58-item report and whole-foundation assessment](PHASE1_FOUNDATION.md#phase-1i--cross-tab-session-coordination). CI remains open; no Phase 2 or 1J is authorized by closure.

## Phase 2 — Domain & Database Design

- **Historical result:** Domain/design delivered with unresolved product-policy blockers; [Phase 2 report](PHASE2_REPORT.md) preserves that snapshot.
- **Goal/deliverables:** FSMO domain contracts, relational candidates, stock/history/transaction invariants, evidence/source reconciliation and future API draft.
- **Current gate:** Superseded by Phase 2.5 owner decisions and current domain baseline; no business tables or code implemented.
- **Non-goals:** No feature implementation, migrations, mockups, boss writes or automatic next phase.

## Phase 2.5 — Product Decision Integration & Domain Rebaseline

- **Result:** COMPLETE — documentation reconciliation only, 2026-10-08; [report](PHASE2_5_REPORT.md).
- **Deliverables:** All 29 working decisions integrated, four-count physical stock plus replacement obligations, six-state lifecycle, deterministic PHP 10/day fine, Admin full clear, revised role matrix,71 active invariants and18 design walkthroughs.
- **Dependency/gate:** Core policy blockers resolved; specific NON-BLOCKING onboarding/disposal/retention/delivery/migration/operations details retained.
- **Non-goals:** No code, SQL, UI, mockups, Phase 1 changes, boss changes, commit/push/deployment; Phase 3A not begun.

## Phase 3A — UX Architecture & Mockups

- **Status:** READY FOR SEPARATE AUTHORIZATION; NOT STARTED.
- **Goal:** Review one coherent responsive UX before feature UI implementation.
- **Deliverables:** Borrower mobile-first catalog/search/filter/quantity/cart/review/request, pending expiry/cancel/denial, status/history/terms/accountability; Staff/Admin desktop/tablet-first review/physical approval/direct issue/partial returns/replacements; Admin full fine clearing and role/navigation designs; accessible wireframes/high-fidelity mockups with responsive adaptations.
- **Dependencies:** Current Phase 2.5 design/permission matrix. Mark engineering assumptions: full-request issue, damaged originals held nonusable, staff-certified equivalents, live full-clear checkpoint balance, draft terms/catalog copy.
- **Non-goals:** No separate hardware kiosk shell/device auth/handoff, code/migrations or assumed deployment. Interactive Kiosk is the borrower catalog/cart flow.
- **Exit gate:** Authorized owner review approves journeys, navigation/permissions, responsive/accessibility behavior and mockups; implementation follows only later approved scope.

## Phase 3B — shadcn Design System & Application Shell

- **Goal:** Create the eLabTrack visual language and responsive accessible shell.
- **Primary deliverables:** shadcn-based eLabTrack design system, project tokens, application shell/navigation, reusable domain UI components and accessible loading/error/empty/responsive patterns based on approved mockups.
- **Dependencies:** Phases 1–2, approved Phase 3A mockups and role/navigation direction sufficient to design the shell.
- **Explicit non-goals:** No full business dashboard, inventory/loan implementation or replacement UI framework.
- **Exit gate:** Shell/tokens approved; compared against approved mockups/responsive behavior, keyboard/mobile/theme checks pass, primitives remain reusable. No later feature UI is complete without that comparison.

## Phase 4 — Authentication & Authorization

- **Goal:** Implement future BORROWER/STAFF/ADMIN policy on the preserved Phase 1 security/session foundation.
- **Deliverables:** Current server permission/ownership checks, named Admin accounts, secure provisioned onboarding design, terms-version acceptance and inactive-account controls, role reconciliation through approved migrations.
- **Dependencies:** Phase 2.5 matrix, approved Phase 3A/3B UX and secure activation/recovery design; no public registration or category-derived authority.
- **Non-goals:** No Phase 1 wholesale rewrite, separate suspension subsystem, device kiosk auth or automatic fine eligibility gate.
- **Exit gate:** Actor/target/role/status/replay/session boundaries pass relevant real database/HTTP/browser tests.

## Phase 5 — Users & Borrower Management

- **Goal:** Provision/manage generic Borrowers and named staff/admin accounts safely.
- **Deliverables:** Staff/Admin narrow Borrower creation, Admin bulk Borrower import/deactivation/privileged accounts, category/program/contact only where justified, preserved historical identity.
- **Dependencies:** Phase 4 secure onboarding and current role matrix; validated bulk template without required plaintext passwords.
- **Non-goals:** No public signup, student-only eligibility, independent suspension table or campus hierarchy.
- **Exit gate:** Normal/privilege-escalation/import/inactive-history tests pass; queries bounded and private data scoped.

## Phase 6 — Equipment & Inventory

- **Goal:** Implement catalog pools and four-count physical inventory with append-only evidence.
- **Deliverables:** Bounded discovery, metadata/version, A/R/C/damaged_held constraints, stock ledger and guarded archive; categories/images as reviewed.
- **Dependencies:** Phases2.5–5; catalog content/storage details and specific original-disposition/correction policy if those features are included.
- **Non-goals:** No serialized tracking, mandatory repair workflow, lost-history physical bucket or inventory edits concealing custody.
- **Exit gate:** Stock reconciliation, permissions, stale edits/archive races and history checks pass; unusable originals remain outside available.

## Phase 7 — Borrowing & Approval

- **Goal:** Implement reserve-on-submit and approval WITH physical release.
- **Deliverables:** PENDING holds,24h expiry/sweep/lazy check, owner pending cancel, required visible denial reason, atomic CHECKED_OUT issue/direct checkout, required due date+time/Asia-Manila/current terms, retained history and idempotency.
- **Dependencies:** Phases4–6, current Phase 2.5 transaction contract; no unresolved reservation/approved-waiting/seven-day gate.
- **Non-goals:** No separate approved-release stage, operating-hours TTL, quota, automatic old-fine prohibition or issued delete/cancel.
- **Exit gate:** Last-stock/decision-expiry/account races and duplicate/replay/rollback tests prove exact holds/custody/history. Expiry release is part of borrowing acceptance, independent of email delivery.

## Phase 8 — Returns & Accountability

- **Goal:** Implement partial returns, damage/loss replacements and full Admin fine clearance.
- **Deliverables:** Immutable unique return/acceptance lines, obligations and acquisition vectors, physical0+replacement0 completion, original due clock, PHP 10 ceiling24h live/final fine and immutable full clear methods/history.
- **Dependencies:** Phase 7, selected stock/fine design; original-disposition detail only gates an included disposal feature, not core replacements.
- **Non-goals:** No automatic damage price charge, partial payment/allocation, online gateway, return-photo/evidence upload, transmission, storage, retention or attachments; no borrower evidence step. Any personally shown phone photo remains outside eLabTrack; Staff/Admin alone records returns. No mandatory repair workflow; independent catalog images remain in Phase 6.
- **Exit gate:** All 18 domain traces proven by relevant unit/real-PG/HTTP tests, duplicate/cross-parent/concurrency/atomicity and Admin-only checks.

## Phase 9 — Notifications & Scheduled Work

- **Goal:** Deliver approved confirmations/reminders with observable failures.
- **Primary deliverables:** Provider adapter, consistent messages, bounded scheduled jobs, delivery/retry/deduplication records and tests.
- **Dependencies:** Phases 7–8; email provider, due/overdue timing and delivery responsibilities agreed.
- **Explicit non-goals:** No unapproved SMS/push provider or distributed broker.
- **Exit gate:** Agreed triggers are reliable, retries are safe, failures visible, and test delivery/schedule boundaries pass.

## Phase 10 — Dashboards & Reporting

- **Goal:** Provide authorized, source-defined operational insight.
- **Primary deliverables:** Approved metrics, bounded dashboard/report queries and required export/print formats.
- **Dependencies:** Phases 5–9; Phase 2.5 lifecycle/replacement/fine definitions and access matrix; final approved report formats.
- **Explicit non-goals:** No generic analytics platform, unbounded global reads or guessed revenue.
- **Exit gate:** Metrics reconcile with authoritative records; authorization, pagination/export limits and accuracy tests pass.

## Phase 11 — Interactive Equipment Catalog / Kiosk Experience

- **Goal:** Complete and validate the academic Interactive Kiosk requirement as normal responsive borrower browse/search/filter/quantity/cart/review/request UX.
- **Deliverables:** End-to-end catalog/cart usability/accessibility, responsive refinements and operator guidance; reuse earlier implemented canonical catalog/request flows, no duplicate app.
- **Dependencies:** Approved Phase 3A/3B flow and Phases4/6/7; Phase 9 notices where included. No device registration, shared-device identity, handoff or hardware policy dependency.
- **Non-goals:** No dedicated touchscreen shell, device tokens/authentication infrastructure, physical tracking or native application.
- **Exit gate:** Mobile-first cart/request and larger-screen adaptations preserve stock/ownership/terms semantics and pass accessibility/usability tests; functional kiosk intent documented.

## Phase 12 — V1 Data Migration

- **Goal:** Migrate only approved legacy data with reconciliation and recoverable cutover.
- **Primary deliverables:** Authorized discovery, mappings, reconciliation rules, dry-run tooling/results, backup/rollback/cutover plan.
- **Dependencies:** Approved scope/data access; stable Phase 2 model and implemented Phases 5–11.
- **Explicit non-goals:** No live V1 mutation without separate authorization or copying unverifiable data assumptions.
- **Exit gate:** Owners sign off reconciled dry run, exclusions and balances; backup/rollback proven before authorized cutover.

## Phase 13 — QA, Security & Optimization

- **Goal:** Validate complete workflows and address measured security/performance risks.
- **Primary deliverables:** End-to-end regression, security review, concurrency/load/accessibility checks, defect fixes and release evidence.
- **Dependencies:** Phases 1–12 with test data, expected workloads and acceptance targets agreed.
- **Explicit non-goals:** No speculative features or infrastructure scaling without measured need.
- **Exit gate:** Required quality gates and risk-based tests pass; critical/high findings resolved or explicitly accepted by accountable owners.

## Phase 14 — Deployment, Pilot & Evaluation

- **Goal:** Deploy through approved controls and evaluate real FSMO operation.
- **Primary deliverables:** Approved deployment/backups/monitoring, operator training, pilot, incident/rollback procedures and evaluation results.
- **Dependencies:** Phase 13 release approval, migration/cutover signoff and operational owners.
- **Explicit non-goals:** No campus rollout or automatic expansion proposal approval.
- **Exit gate:** Pilot meets agreed operational criteria; incidents/lessons and stakeholder evaluation recorded; future work remains separately approved.

## Future separate project — Campus-Wide Equipment System Proposal

- **Goal:** evaluate whether measured V2 outcomes justify a broader school proposal.
- **Primary deliverables:** separately requested scope/feasibility/governance proposal informed by the FSMO pilot.
- **Dependencies:** Phase 14 evidence and explicit school sponsorship.
- **Explicit non-goals:** no campus architecture, tenancy or cross-department implementation in current V2.
- **Exit gate:** independent stakeholder decision on whether to authorize that future project.
